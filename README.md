# Binary-Converter-And-More
 Program to convert values between Decimal, Binary, Oct, and ARC Assembly Commands using Java

Implementation was made with a different formula for each method, mostly using recursion. 
I save a lot of the information as strings and convert between Integers and Doubles so that aspect 
of the program could definitely be made more efficient. 

The program is very easy to test as it uses MAVEN to import the JUnit 5 library for testing each
conversion method individually. I've only added a couple of tests but will add more to be confident
there is no edge cases.

I was planning on adding JSwing GUI library to the program, but I am still considering it. This is 
definable not a long-term project I just wanted to use Java to make a simple conversion calculator
with the addition of converting to Assembly ARC commands.
